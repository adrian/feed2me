Ideas for Improvement

* Send an email if there's a problem fetching/parsing a feed
* Add feature to snooze feed (stop checking for updates)
* Show the date of last post for each feed in the UI
* Record the number of posts in the past three months and include in the UI
* If a feed fails three times snooze it and flag on UI

* Make the email subject and body configurable
* Include the date the feed was last checked on UI
* Investigate using GAE Task Queues
* Support Readability for publishing
* Use templates in the UI
* More tests for CheckFeedsHandler
* Use a request per feed to check feeds for new entries
* Support for daily digest rather than mail per entry
* Include user's email address on UI
* Improve the UI look and feel
* Paginate feeds
* Import/Export feeds

* DONE Check each blog for updates once a day. Spread the checks throughout the day.
